# Kanbn Format Specification

## Purpose
Standardized format for `kanbn` planning boards used by the HyperPM agent.
This format is compatible with the [kanbn](https://github.com/basementuniverse/kanbn) tool and VS Code extension.

## Directory Structure
- **Root**: `.kanbn/`
- **Index File**: `.kanbn/index.md`
- **Tasks Directory**: `.kanbn/tasks/`
- **Task Files**: `.kanbn/tasks/<task-id>.md`

## Index File Structure (`index.md`)

The index file defines the board columns and lists the tasks within them.

```markdown

# Optional Project Options in YAML front-matter

# Project Name

Project description goes here.

## Backlog

- [task-title] (tasks/task-title.md)
- [another-task] (tasks/another-task.md)

## In Progress

- [active-task] (tasks/active-task.md)

## Done

- [completed-task] (tasks/completed-task.md)
```

### Rules for Index
- **Use Options**: For new boards, use the above YAML front-matter options.
- **Level-1 Heading**: Must be the Project Name.
- **Level-2 Headings**: Define the Columns (Lanes).`
- **Task Links**: Must be relative links to files in the `tasks/` directory. Format: `- [filename] (tasks/<filename>.md)`. Must use kebab-case for filenames and titles, they must match exactly. NO spaces between brackets and parentheses (the example above with a space is to make this stupid markdown parser not freak out...).

## Task File Structure (`tasks/<task-id>.md`)

Each task is a separate markdown file.
